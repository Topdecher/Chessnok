# Chessnok
Chessnok is a brand new board game made by some abitious men (not me). You can check their Boomstarter https://boomstarter.ru/projects/458670/chess_no_k_kollektsionnaya_kartochnaya_igra_po_shahmatam
And also their VK group https://vk.com/nastolkin_store
This project is intended to remake the game into the computer version.
It also implements an engine for CCGs (Collectable Cards Games) which can be easily modified for creating Hearthstone-like games or Gwent-like games for example.
